### Recommender-System-Item-Based

Recommender systems rose in popularity in the 1990s with Amazon being one of the more prominent early adopters.  Today, recommender systems can be seen everywhere - from the movies we watch, to the music we listen to, to the articles we read.  Even people can be recommended as "items" in dating apps like Tinder.  Recommender systems have become so profitable to companies in terms of increasing user activity, maximizing revenue, and reducing customer churn that [Netflix famously offered a million dollars](https://www.netflixprize.com/) to the person/team who could improve the accuracy of their recommendation predictions by 10%.  The winning algorithm was [so complicated](https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/) that the engineering costs to implement it outweighed the benefits.  In this project, I build a simple, item-based collaborative filtering recommender system with cosine similarity using the 9,000 movies dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
